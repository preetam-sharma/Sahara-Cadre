                            Shifting is a tedious task and that too with regards to vehicle shifting. The vehicle is not only an investment for us, but it is an important element of our life as well. In a country like India where traffic is still a big issue and dependence on public transport is not everyone s piece of cake, people tend to have their two-wheeler if they are shifting to a new place.

                        <P> Changing location is a tough task and along with this comes the toughest time of decision-making as to what to take to the next destination and what to leave behind. As the vehicle is one of the much-needed elements in our daily living. As two-wheeler is easy to maintain and easy to carry; hence people take their bike with them when shifting.</P>
